General Information

VolArea is the most recent software developed by the Group of Computational BioChemistry (CBC) belonging to the research institute REQUIMTE and the Faculty of Sciences of the University of Porto in Portugal. This package is a plug-in of the widely spread molecular graphics software - Visual Molecular Dynamics (VMD) -  which allows the calculation of the volume and the exposed surface area of practically any protein structure (including binding site). The surface area can be used to map or calculate the exposed area of a chemical structure to the solvent or to another chemical structure. This is particularly useful to characterize protein:ligand complexes or even protein:protein interfaces. The volume algorithm can be used to predict the space occupied by any chemical structure as well as the volume of cavities, such as tunnels, clefts, etc.

Running VolArea only requires a few instructions from the user that are managed by a very intuitive graphical interface. The results of the calculations are presented into two different sections: one is devoted to the surface area and the other to the volume of the analyzed area. These values can then  be analyzed in three different ways: 1. using the VMD graphical interface window 2. in an xy plot and 3. in other softwares (for this purpose the software allows to export the data in txt format).

Instalation:

VolArea is a multi-platform plug-in and therefore should work in windows, Linux and MacOs platforms.

The installation of the program is very straightforward  and only take four simples steps:

 1-Download VolArea package.
 2-Uncompress the tar.gz file to your Desktop folder
 3-Open the VMD program and open the VMD TK console as depicted in the picture below:

 4-In the Tk console write the following lines:

          cd Desktop/VolArea (go to the directory where the program was extracted)

          play install.tcl

Enjoy VolArea and please report all buggs or difficulties, so we can improve it.
